Going to try doing the rest of chapter 2 in org-mode.
* TODO 2.43
* DONE 2.42

    Originally thought rest of queens was a list of row, col pairs.  More
    space efficient is to represent just the rows and index of them is the column.
  Aha! =rest-of-queens= is a list of integers corresponding to rows.

** DONE Why do I need =k= for =safe?=

     Done now.

     See above: list of rows.
* N-Queens
  biatch, this is a significant point to be at....
  using enumerate, filter, map, flatmap, map with function that takes
  function?
